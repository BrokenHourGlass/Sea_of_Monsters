For "A Sea of Monsters," the art style should evoke the rich textures and tones of ancient maritime civilizations. This can be achieved with a painterly look that blends realistic historical detail with a touch of fantastical elements to bring the mythology to life. The visuals should feel like moving through an animated ancient map, with a color palette that reflects the natural materials of the era—rich woods, weathered sails, and the azure blue of the sea. Stylized yet readable icons and UI elements will ensure players can navigate the game world with ease. Each sprite and texture should feel like part of a cohesive ancient world, blending seamlessly with the game’s historical theme.
