# Development, Coding, and Design Guidelines for "A Sea of Monsters"

## 1. Development Guidelines

### Version Control
- Use Git for version control.
- Commit early and often with clear, concise commit messages.
- Branching should follow the feature-branch workflow.

### Issue Tracking
- Use issue tracking tools to manage and keep track of bugs, features, and tasks.
- Every commit should reference the issue it is related to.

### Documentation
- Document the design and architecture of the game within the `/documentation` folder.
- Use inline comments sparingly. Code should be self-explanatory unless it is doing something non-obvious.

### Testing
- Write tests where possible and aim for high coverage, especially for critical game systems.
- Use Godot's built-in testing framework for unit and integration tests.

## 2. Coding Guidelines

### Language and Frameworks
- The primary language will be GDScript for scripting.
- Use C++ for performance-critical sections of code.
- Follow the official [Godot GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).

### Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for class names, e.g., `PlayerCharacter`.
- Use snake_case for functions, variables, and file names, e.g., `move_player`, `player_health`, `inventory_manager.gd`.
- Constants should be in ALL_CAPS with underscore separators, e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`.
- Prefix boolean variables with `is_`, `can_`, or `has_` to indicate a true/false value, e.g., `is_visible`, `can_jump`.
- Use descriptive names for all variables and functions. Avoid abbreviations.

### Coding Standards
- Encapsulate and modularize code. Classes should have a single responsibility.
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
- Use Godot signals for event handling and callbacks.
- Comment your code only when it adds value. Avoid obvious comments.
- Handle errors gracefully and avoid silent failures.

### Architectural Patterns
- Follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for separation of concerns.
- Use Godot's scene and node system effectively, keeping in mind the "tree" structure in which nodes inherit behaviors from their parents.
- Utilize Godot's built-in nodes and scenes for reusability.

## 3. Design Guidelines

### Art and Assets
- Maintain a consistent style as defined in the Art Bible.
- Assets should be named clearly and placed in the correct folders within the `assets` directory.

### UI/UX Design
- Follow the UX Design Document for interface design and interactions.
- Ensure that UI is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and aspect ratios.

### Sound and Music
- Audio assets should be high quality but appropriately compressed.
- Music and sound effects should not be intrusive and must enhance the game experience.

### Accessibility
- Design with accessibility in mind. Include options for subtitles, colorblind modes, and alternative controls where possible.

## 4. Asset Pipeline Guidelines

### Asset Creation
- All assets must be created following the specifications outlined in the Art Bible.
- Assets should be optimized for performance without compromising quality.

### Asset Importation
- Assets are to be imported using Godot's standard import tools.
- Make sure the import settings are configured for the best balance between quality and performance, according to the type of asset.

### Asset Management
- Assets should be organized in a clear directory structure within the Godot project:
  - `/assets/audio/music` for background music tracks.
  - `/assets/audio/sfx` for sound effects.
  - `/assets/graphics/characters` for character sprites and textures.
  - `/assets/graphics/environments` for environment and level art.
  - `/assets/graphics/ui` for user interface elements.
  - `/assets/animations` for animation files.
- Each asset type should have its own subfolder under the main asset type directory.

### Naming Conventions
- Asset files should be named in a clear and descriptive manner, following the snake_case convention:
  - `ancient_map_texture.png` for a texture of an ancient map.
  - `ocean_wave_sfx.ogg` for a sound effect of an ocean wave.
- Use prefixes to denote the asset type where applicable, e.g., `bg_` for background images, `spr_` for sprites.

### Asset Updates and Versions
- When updating an asset, increment a version number in the filename, e.g., `ship_sprite_v2.png`.
- Keep only the latest version of an asset in the active project directory to avoid clutter.

### File Formats
- Use standard file formats that are widely supported and efficient in terms of quality and size:
  - `.png` or `.webp` for images.
  - `.ogg` for audio.
  - `.glb` or `.escn` for 3D models. 

## Conclusion
By following these guidelines, we aim to create a robust, maintainable, and cohesive codebase for "A Sea of Monsters". These are living documents and should be updated as the project evolves and we learn more about what works best for our team and project.
